        About Me
        <p>I am a full stack web developer with a certificate in full stack web development from the University of Toronto Coding Bootcamp. I have also done three years studying biology and psychology at the University of Toronto. My newly acquired skills include JavaScript, MySQL, MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, and other libraries and frameworks such as Bootstrap, Bulma, and jQuery. I look forward to contributing my problem-solving skills on a fast-paced team and to familiarizing myself with more technologies as I progress.</p>
